# Binary trees

This project task is expounds on of the many data structures known, which is the binary trees. Here are the following concepts treated:
     * creating a binary tree node
     * inserting a node at either of its side node branches
     * deleting a binary tree
     * checking for a leaf node
     * checking if a node is a root
     * traversing a binary tree using pre-order traversal
     * traversing a binary tree using in-order traversal
     * traversing a binary tree using post-order traversal
     * measuring the height of a binary tree
     * measuring the depth of a node in a binary tree
     * measuring the size of a binary tree
     * counting leaf nodes in a binary tree
     * measuring the balance factor of a binary tree
     * checking if a binary tree is full
     * checking if a binary tree is perfect
     * finding the sibling of a node
     * finding the uncle of a node
